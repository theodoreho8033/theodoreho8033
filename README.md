Hello! I'm Theodore Ho!

I graduated highest-honors in the major from the University of California, Santa Cruz in June 2023 for a B.S. in Computer Science. In Fall of 2023, I began my Masters program at the University of Southern California for a M.S. in Computer Science with a specialization in artificial intelligence where I currently maintain a 3.6/4 GPA and expect to graduate in May 2025. 

While in school, I work part-time as a Data Engineer at Taulia a global supply chain financing company parented by SAP; a position I was offered after completing an internship with Taulia in the Summer of 2022. 

In my years of study and professional expierience, I've seen first hand how data can drive buisness operations, provide new perspectives, and fuel artifical intelligence to tackle the worlds most compilcated problems. I plan to continue to develop my expertise in leveraging data and make a career out of it. 

Below you will find some of the projects I've conducted along the way.

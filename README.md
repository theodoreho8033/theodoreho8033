Hi, Iâ€™m Theodore Ho ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed my M.S. in Computer Science (AI specialization) at the University of Southern California, after graduating with Highest Honors from UC Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Science.

While in school, I worked part-time as a Data Engineer at Taulia, a global supply chain financing company under SAP. I joined the team after a successful internship in 2022, and have since built data pipelines supporting payments, compliance, and risk operations.

Iâ€™m also the lead engineer behind [AIToolHub.co](https://aitoolhub.co), an AI-native platform for discovering tools through LLM-powered, agentic search. It autonomously crawls, interprets, and categorizes tools using prompt-driven workflowsâ€”turning unstructured data into semantically searchable insights used by thousands every week. LLMs are powerful, but only as effective as the context and orchestration around them. I believe prompt chaining, RAG, and agentic loops are essential to fully unlocking their potentialâ€”and AIToolHub is my way of testing those ideas at scale.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, Iâ€™ve seen how data can drive operations, surface insight, and power intelligent systems. Iâ€™m passionate about building tools that make those capabilities accessible, fast, and intuitiveâ€”and I plan to build a career doing just that.

Below, youâ€™ll find a few of the projects Iâ€™ve built along the way.
